Runs the app in the development mode.\

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### NOTE 

Frequently the api throws a 429 status, the request limit seems to be a 2 per minute or 30 seconds 
so if it seems the app hasnt start o doesnt work PLEASE check is not just a 429 status which is an api problem.
